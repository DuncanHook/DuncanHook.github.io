### aYo, the Voice Assistant for Software Developers

<ul>
  <li>
    My senior project from SPU. I together with my 3 teammates created a voice assistant focused on Software Developers.It can search (some) code documentation with a voice         prompt such as "aYo, c++ vectors" and it will take you to the C++ reference page for vectors. It also supports general things such as playing music, asking it to set an         alarm, do a general search without searching official documentation, etc. <br>

### Dungeon of Squares

<ul>
  <li>
    A small game created in Qt. The player is tasked with getting through 3 floors, and after accomplishing that task it becomes a survival challenge asking the player to get as     far as they can. I created the enemy movement system, which is randomly moving across the board to pose as obstacles to the player. And I also created the combat system         which is a psuedo blackjack style game.<br>

### Swift Strike

<ul>
  <li>
    A small game created in unity. This project was the final project of my game development class, in which I took on a producer style role. Our class was split into two by the teacher, and the team I was on didn't have anybody familiar with making anything sound related. So I asked the teacher if I could reach out to the music department in our school to see if I could requisite some help, in which he said if the music department/teachers were okay with that then I could. So I approached the music department, made my case, and was able to enlist two lovely students from the music department who effectively had their final for their audio production class replaced with our game. My role from then on was to act as an intermediary between my team and our two audio folks, bringing the needs of my team to them, and vice versa. I then implemented the music and sound effects into our game. 
  </li>
  <li>
    outside of my time working with our sound department I helped ideate our three characters, as well as making our game xbox compatible and testing the controls and everything about the game on the xbox. <br>

### Small Group Maker

<ul>
  <li>
    This program takes in a list of names and then, after asking the user what size of groups they want, determines how many weeks it will take to every name on the list to host every other name at their 'house'. As well as showing all of the groups the program has made. This program is written in python and assigns each name as a node in a directed graph. <br> 
    Created as a group.

### Long Distance Deployer System Specification

<ul>
  <li>
   A paper which covers a theoretical system that would allow an individual to work on a project from home using their work equipment using a virtual machine. A system which would allow employees to work from home given the need to, but allow them to use their possibly much more powerful computers that they have at the office. <br> Created individually.
