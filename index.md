### NetEase Internal Testing Support Tool
<ul> 
  <li>
    An internal tool built for NetEase Games and their partner studios, allowing any user to setup template Jira tickets for their team, and then create and post jira tickets with media attachments related to their current testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowed users to setup a custom keybind that when hit, would take a screenshot, capture the last 30+ seconds of footage and attach this media to a pre-setup jira ticket template, which then could be posted to their associated team's template. Supported testing on PC, Xbox, and Playstation, and additionally had an Unreal Engine Plugin that helped with easy integration for users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Primary Language: JavaScript
  </li>
</ul>

### NetEase Internal Automated Testing Management Tool
<ul>
  <li>
    An internal web based tool built for NetEase Games and their partner studios, allowing users to easily manage their automated testing pipeline, and recieve and parse the resulting logs from Jenkins. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowed users to setup a Perforce connection for their current Unreal Engine project and manage running automated tests on Jenkins. Allowed users to setup test groups to send to jenkins (allows running of a group of tests A, and B, or a group of A, and C for example). Then would receive the test logs from Jenkins allowing users to easily see their tests fail and successes all in one place, additionally allowed users to easily see what stage their tests failed on assuming it did fail.
  </li>
  <li>
    Primary Languages: Frontend - JavaScript, Backend - Python, Database - SQL
  </li>
</ul>

### Disney Internal Deployment Tool
<ul>
  <li>
    An internal command line tool built for Disney Streaming that was used to allow any user to build, run, and test for any platform. It would pull down appropriate binary versions for any reqeuested version and supported platform. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Supported personal profiles to concatonate all specifications for a specific build (I.E. allowed a user to have a collection of Environment Variables, a particular version, and a platform) and reference it easier with a single flag instead of many individual flags. This made testing things much quicker and more convenient as it made testing look like: <b>Tool Run --profile1</b> instead of <b>Tool Run --flag1 --flag2 --flag3</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Primary Language: Rust
  </li>
</ul>

### aYo, the Voice Assistant for Software Developers

<ul>
  <li>
    My senior project from SPU. I together with my 3 teammates created a voice assistant focused on Software Developers.It can search (some) code documentation with a voice         prompt such as "aYo, c++ vectors" and it will take you to the C++ reference page for vectors. It also supports general things such as playing music, asking it to set an         alarm, do a general search without searching official documentation, etc. <br>

### Dungeon of Squares

<ul>
  <li>
    A small game created in Qt. The player is tasked with getting through 3 floors, and after accomplishing that task it becomes a survival challenge asking the player to get as     far as they can. I created the enemy movement system, which is randomly moving across the board to pose as obstacles to the player. And I also created the combat system         which is a psuedo blackjack style game.<br>

### Swift Strike

<ul>
  <li>
    A small game created in unity. This project was the final project of my game development class, in which I took on a producer style role. Our class was split into two by the teacher, and the team I was on didn't have anybody familiar with making anything sound related. So I asked the teacher if I could reach out to the music department in our school to see if I could requisite some help, in which he said if the music department/teachers were okay with that then I could. So I approached the music department, made my case, and was able to enlist two lovely students from the music department who effectively had their final for their audio production class replaced with our game. My role from then on was to act as an intermediary between my team and our two audio folks, bringing the needs of my team to them, and vice versa. I then implemented the music and sound effects into our game. 
  </li>
  <li>
    outside of my time working with our sound department I helped ideate our three characters, as well as making our game xbox compatible and testing the controls and everything about the game on the xbox. <br>

### Small Group Maker

<ul>
  <li>
    This program takes in a list of names and then, after asking the user what size of groups they want, determines how many weeks it will take to every name on the list to host every other name at their 'house'. As well as showing all of the groups the program has made. This program is written in python and assigns each name as a node in a directed graph. <br> 
    Created as a group.
  </li>
</ul>

An example of the what the program outputs with a 34 person list: <br>

### Long Distance Deployer System Specification

<ul>
  <li>
   A paper which covers a theoretical system that would allow an individual to work on a project from home using their work equipment using a virtual machine. A system which would allow employees to work from home given the need to, but allow them to use their possibly much more powerful computers that they have at the office. <br> Created individually.
