### aYo, the Voice Assistant for Software Developers

<ul>
  <li>
    My senior project from SPU. I together with my 3 teammates created a voice assistant focused on Software Developers.It can search (some) code documentation with a voice         prompt such as "aYo, c++ vectors" and it will take you to the C++ reference page for vectors. It also supports general things such as playing music, asking it to set an         alarm, do a general search without searching official documentation, etc. <br>
    Created as a Group

### Dungeon of Squares

<ul>
  <li>
    A small game created in Qt. The player is tasked with getting through 3 floors, and after accomplishing that task it becomes a survival challenge asking the player to get as     far as they can. I created the enemy movement system, which is randomly moving across the board to pose as obstacles to the player. And I also created the combat system         which is a psuedo blackjack style game.<br>

   A paper which covers a theoretical system that would allow an individual to work on a project from home using their work equipment using a virtual machine. A system which would allow employees to work from home given the need to, but allow them to use their possibly much more powerful computers that they have at the office. <br> Created individually.
